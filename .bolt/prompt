Build a complete fullstack web app using React (with TypeScript), Tailwind CSS, React Router, Node.js (Express), and Supabase for authentication and database.
The app should include the following pages:

Home

Login/Register (with Google and Email OTP login via Supabase)

Dashboard (protected route, shows user wallet and history)

Matches or Game page (protected route)

Settings page

Backend should handle API routes for user data, game logic, and wallet transactions.
Supabase should store user profiles, game history, and wallet balance.
Routing should be set up using React Router and protected routes should redirect unauthenticated users to Login.

Implement file structure with pages/, components/, hooks/, lib/, and utils/. Include example API routes and protected route logic.

Make sure the frontend and backend are connected properly and that the app works end-to-end with Supabase.
